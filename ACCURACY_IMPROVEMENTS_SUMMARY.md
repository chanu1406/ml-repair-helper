## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Feature Engineering (11 New Features)

#### Time-Based Features
- **`vehicle_age`**: Age of vehicle at incident time
  - Captures depreciation and wear patterns
  - Range: 0-50 years

- **`days_to_claim`**: Days between policy bind date and incident
  - Fraud indicator (very short or very long periods suspicious)
  - Range: 0-3,650 days (10 years max)

- **`time_of_day`**: Categorized incident hour
  - Categories: Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night
  - Different risk profiles per time period

#### Financial Ratios
- **`claim_to_premium_ratio`**: Claim amount relative to annual premium
  - Fraud indicator (abnormally high ratios)
  - Helps identify outlier claims

- **`deductible_ratio`**: Deductible relative to premium
  - Risk tolerance indicator
  - Higher deductibles = lower premiums = different claim patterns

#### Vehicle Characteristics
- **`is_luxury_brand`**: Boolean for luxury vehicles
  - Brands: Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Lexus, Porsche, Jaguar, Land Rover, Tesla, Maserati, Alfa Romeo, Infiniti, Acura
  - Luxury vehicles have higher repair costs

- **`is_high_theft_model`**: Boolean for commonly stolen models
  - Models: Honda Civic/Accord, Toyota Camry/Corolla, Nissan Altima, Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra
  - Affects claim likelihood and cost

#### Incident Indicators
- **`has_bodily_injury`**: Boolean for injury claims
  - Separates pure vehicle damage from injury claims
  - Different cost drivers

- **`has_property_damage`**: Boolean for property damage
  - Additional cost beyond vehicle

- **`police_and_witnesses`**: Combined indicator
  - Both police report AND witnesses present
  - Higher credibility claims

### 2. Data-Driven Business Rules

Instead of hardcoded multipliers, we calculated actual statistics from the data:

#### Regional Multipliers (By State)
```
Most Expensive States:
  NY: 1.07x (7% above average)
  SC: 1.03x (3% above average)

Least Expensive States:
  NC: 0.93x (7% below average)
  PA: 0.94x (6% below average)
  OH: 0.94x (6% below average)
```

**Impact:** Regional adjustments now reflect actual claim costs in each state rather than guesswork.

#### Severity Ratios (% of Vehicle Value)
```
Trivial Damage:  28.5% of vehicle value
Minor Damage:    33.4% of vehicle value
Total Loss:     159.8% of vehicle value (includes injuries, property)
Major Damage:   174.7% of vehicle value (includes injuries, property)
```

**Key Insight:** Total Loss and Major Damage exceed vehicle value due to:
- Bodily injury claims
- Property damage
- Legal/administrative costs

**Previous Hardcoded Values:**
- Minor: 20%
- Major: 50%
- Total Loss: 100%

**Improvement:** Actual ratios are significantly different, especially for severe damage.

#### Collision Type Multipliers
```
Front Collision:  1.23x (23% above average)
Side Collision:   1.19x (19% above average)
Rear Collision:   1.17x (17% above average)
```

**Impact:** Front collisions are most expensive (airbag deployment, engine damage).

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning

#### Search Method
- **Algorithm:** RandomizedSearchCV
- **Iterations:** 20 random combinations
- **Cross-Validation:** 3-fold
- **Metric:** MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- **Compute:** All CPU cores utilized

#### Optimal Parameters Found
```python
max_iter: 500              # (vs default 100)
max_depth: 20              # (vs default None)
learning_rate: 0.05        # (vs default 0.1)
l2_regularization: 0.0     # (vs default 0.0)
min_samples_leaf: 10       # (vs default 20)
```

**Impact:**
- Deeper trees (max_depth=20) capture complex patterns
- More iterations (500) ensure convergence
- Slower learning rate (0.05) prevents overfitting

#### Cross-Validation Score
- **CV MAE:** $1,093.11
- **Validation MAE:** $740.60

The validation MAE is better than CV MAE, indicating the model generalizes well.

### 4. Enhanced Evaluation Metrics

Beyond just MAE and R², we now track:

1. **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** $1,212.34
   - Penalizes large errors more heavily than MAE
   - Useful for understanding worst-case scenarios

2. **Median Absolute Error:** $410.15
   - Robust to outliers (vs MAE which is affected by outliers)
   - Half of predictions are within $410 of actual

3. **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error):** 1.98%
   - Predictions are off by ~2% on average
   - Scale-independent metric

4. **Distribution Analysis:**
   - Median AE ($410) much lower than Mean AE ($740)
   - Indicates most predictions are very accurate, with a few larger errors pulling up the average

## Limitations & Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Small Dataset:** Only 1,000 claims
   - Limits model generalization
   - May not capture rare scenarios
   - **Solution:** Acquire more data

2. **No Real Market Data Yet:**
   - Using industry depreciation curves
   - Market prices can vary ±20% from estimates
   - **Solution:** Implement web scrapers

3. **Single Model Architecture:**
   - One model for all claim types
   - Different claim types have different patterns
   - **Solution:** Train separate models

4. **No Temporal Validation:**
   - Random train/test split
   - Doesn't account for time-based trends
   - **Solution:** Use time-based split for production

### Data Quality Issues

1. **Empty Column `_c39`:**
   - All values missing
   - Should be removed from dataset
   - Currently ignored by imputer

2. **Missing Values:**
   - Some features have high missingness
   - Using median/mode imputation
   - Could be improved with MICE
